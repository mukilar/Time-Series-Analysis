# Ditching Coal: How the United States Is Moving Away from One Fossil Fuel
The dataset used in this project is taken from the official U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) website. 
Source: https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/. 
The dataset shows the U.S. National Monthly Net Electricity Generation from Coal in Million kWh from January 1995 to June 2020.

In this project, I will be using various time series forecasting tools like Naive method, Seasonal Naive, Decomposition, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA vs ETS forecasting and cross-validation of the accuracy measures on the above mentioned dataset. The goal is to evaluate their accuracy measures and select the best method to forecast the values for next 5 years.

Note: This project was submitted as a part of the finals in the DSC 551 course in the UNCW's M.S in Data Science Program.
